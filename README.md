## Magnific Popup

The Hospital Website utilizes the Magnific Popup library for displaying image galleries and videos. The necessary JavaScript and CSS files for Magnific Popup are included in the `libs/` directory. To use Magnific Popup, refer to the documentation provided by the library: [Magnific Popup Documentation](https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html). You can customize the gallery and video settings by modifying the appropriate JavaScript code in the `scripts.js` file.

The Hospital Website uses the AOS library to animate elements as they scroll into view. AOS provides various animation effects and configuration options to enhance the user experience.
